# Challenge-5-planner


## Discription
This project was a little tricky, but what kept me motivated was the little challenges i had to overcome to complete this project. The purpose of this project was to create a planner that saves information to local storage. this meant i have to write java script from scratch and make some changes to html and css. during this project I learned a few things such as textboxes and dayjs.
